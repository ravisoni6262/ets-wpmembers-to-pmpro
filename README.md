## Description

The **wp-members-to-pmpro-migration-plugin** simplifies the migration process from "wp-members" to "Paid Memberships Pro" (pmpro). Developed by [ExpressTechSoftwares](https://github.com/expressTechSoftwares), this plugin streamlines the transition by addressing two primary objectives:

1. **Generate Ready CSV for PMPRO:**
   - Automates the creation of a CSV file, ready for importing into "Paid Memberships Pro." The CSV file includes essential user data and membership details from your existing "wp-members" plugin.

2. **Export Restricted Content Compatibility:**
   - Ensures compatibility with "Paid Memberships Pro" by exporting and restructuring restricted content. Your existing restricted content seamlessly integrates with pmpro, preserving access restrictions and membership settings.

## Installation

1. Install and activate the plugin through the WordPress admin dashboard.
2. Configure migration settings by navigating to the plugin settings in the WordPress admin.
3. Initiate the migration process to generate the CSV file and export restricted content.

## Usage

1. **CSV Generation:**
   - After configuring migration settings, the plugin will generate a CSV file containing user and membership data suitable for importing into "Paid Memberships Pro."

2. **Export Restricted Content:**
   - The plugin ensures compatibility by exporting and restructuring restricted content. Your pmpro-compatible content maintains access restrictions and membership settings.

## Compatibility

Tested and compatible with the latest versions of WordPress, "wp-members," and "Paid Memberships Pro."
